## Create the `conda` environment from the `environment.yml` file

To run the code in this repository, cloning the conda environment is recommended. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

This will create a new conda environment called 'imm-mk-env'. To activate the environment, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda activate imm-mk-env
```

For updating the environment from the `environment.yml` file, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

This action should be done if the `environment.yml` file is updated.

> [!WARNING]
> Before running the code, make sure to activate (or create) the conda environment by running the command `conda activate imm-mk-env`.
